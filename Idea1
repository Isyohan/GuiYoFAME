A game a bit like the mini metro where the goal is to manage the traffic of metro stations.
Here the objective would be to manage rail traffic within countries and air traffic between France and the United States but also within them(ex: Paris-Marseille or New York-Los Angeles)

In fact, the game screen would consist of a world map where stations or airports appear over time.
people would also appear and want to travel between two points.
The goal is to manage the traffic so that everyone can go where they want without overloading the stations.
The number of routes (rail or air) is limited.
Planes and trains run at constant speed. planes go faster than trains.

We lose when a station is overloaded.
It is possible to win (by unlocking all the stations) and then the goal is to be faster.
A score, a time and a name wil be saved.
